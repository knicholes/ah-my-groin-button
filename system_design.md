   - Stores audio files in specific format

### Optional Components
1. **Volume Control Potentiometer** - Adjustable volume
2. **Power Switch** - Manual on/off control
3. **Status LED** - Power/activity indicator

## Audio File Requirements
- **Format**: WAV or MP3
- **Sample Rate**: 16kHz (for WAV)
- **Bit Depth**: 8-bit (for WAV)
- **Channels**: Mono
- **File Names**: Must be named "0001.wav", "0002.wav", "0003.wav", etc.
- **Location**: Place in "/mp3" folder on SD card
- **Quantity**: 1-10 files supported (configurable in code)
- **Random Selection**: Device automatically selects different file each time
- **No Repeats**: Avoids playing the same file twice in a row

## Power System Design

### Battery Configuration
**Option A: 2x AA Batteries (Recommended)**
- Total voltage: 3V (1.5V each)
- Capacity: ~2500mAh (alkaline)
- Directly powers 3.3V Arduino Pro Mini
- No voltage regulator needed
- Excellent battery life

**Option B: Single 18650 Li-ion Battery**
- Voltage: 3.7V nominal
- Capacity: 3500-4200mAh
- Requires voltage regulator or direct connection
- Rechargeable option

### Power Optimization Techniques
1. **Remove Power LED** from Arduino Pro Mini
2. **Remove Voltage Regulator** (if using direct battery connection)
3. **Use Sleep Mode** - Arduino sleeps when not in use
4. **Power DFPlayer Only When Needed** - Use enable pin

### Expected Battery Life
With optimizations:
- **Standby**: ~5-10µA current draw
- **Playing**: ~150mA for 2-3 seconds
- **Estimated Life**: 6-12 months with daily use

## Physical Design

### Enclosure Requirements
- Pocket-sized: ~4" x 3" x 1.5"
- Large cutout for red button (accessible on top)
- Small holes for speaker grille
- Access port for SD card
- Battery compartment (removable/accessible)
- Optional: Barrel connector for external power

### Button Requirements
- 3-4" diameter emergency stop button
- Momentary contact (normally open)
- Mushroom head style
- Red color for dramatic effect
- Panel mount compatible

## Circuit Design

### Core Connections
```
Arduino Pro Mini (3.3V) -> DFPlayer Mini
- Pin 2 -> Button input (with pull-up)
- Pin 3 -> DFPlayer RX
- Pin 4 -> DFPlayer TX  
- Pin 5 -> DFPlayer Enable (optional power control)
- VCC -> 3.3V from batteries
- GND -> Common ground

DFPlayer Mini -> Audio Output
- SPK+ -> Speaker positive
- SPK- -> Speaker negative
- VCC -> 3.3V (or separate 5V if available)
- GND -> Common ground

Button Circuit
- One side -> Arduino Pin 2
- Other side -> GND
- Internal pull-up resistor enabled in code
```

### Power Management
- Arduino controls DFPlayer power via enable pin
- Sleep mode when not in use
- Wake on button press interrupt
