## Power Optimization Strategies

### Arduino Optimization (Critical for Battery Life)

**Hardware Modifications:**
1. **Remove Power LED** (saves 8-10mA continuously)
   - Desolder or cut the power LED from the Arduino Pro Mini
   - This is the single most important optimization

2. **Remove Voltage Regulator** (Advanced, optional)
   - If using exactly 3V input, regulator not needed
   - Saves ~300µA when active
   - Requires careful desoldering of SMD components

3. **Disable Unused Peripherals**
   ```cpp
   power_adc_disable();     // Disable ADC
   power_spi_disable();     // Disable SPI
   power_twi_disable();     // Disable I2C
   power_timer1_disable();  // Disable Timer1
   power_timer2_disable();  // Disable Timer2
   ```

**Software Optimizations:**
1. **Sleep Mode Implementation**
   ```cpp
   set_sleep_mode(SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN);  // Deepest sleep
   sleep_bod_disable();                  // Disable brown-out detection
   ```

2. **Minimize Active Time**
   - Fast wake-up from interrupt
   - Efficient audio playback
   - Quick return to sleep

3. **DFPlayer Power Control**
   - Use enable pin to completely power off DFPlayer
   - Only enable during audio playback
   - Saves ~25mA when not in use

### DFPlayer Optimization

**Power Control Circuit:**
```
Arduino Pin 5 → DFPlayer Enable Pin
```

**Software Control:**
```cpp
void enableDFPlayer() {
  digitalWrite(DFPLAYER_ENABLE, HIGH);
  delay(500);  // Allow startup time
}

void disableDFPlayer() {
  digitalWrite(DFPLAYER_ENABLE, LOW);
}
```

## Battery Life Calculations

### Scenario 1: Daily Use (5 button presses)
```
Sleep current: 10µA
Active time per day: 5 presses × 3 seconds = 15 seconds
Active current: 150mA average during playback

Daily consumption:
Sleep: 10µA × 24 hours = 240µAh
Active: 150mA × 15 seconds = 0.625mAh
Total per day: ~0.87mAh

Battery life: 2500mAh ÷ 0.87mAh = ~7.9 years

Practical life (accounting for self-discharge): 12-18 months
```

### Scenario 2: Heavy Use (20 button presses daily)
```
Active time per day: 20 presses × 3 seconds = 60 seconds
Active consumption: 150mA × 60 seconds = 2.5mAh
Total per day: ~2.74mAh

Battery life: 2500mAh ÷ 2.74mAh = ~2.5 years
Practical life: 8-12 months
```

### Scenario 3: Party Mode (100 button presses)
```
Active time: 100 presses × 3 seconds = 300 seconds
Active consumption: 150mA × 300 seconds = 12.5mAh
Sleep consumption: 240µAh

Total per day: ~12.74mAh
Battery life for regular party use: ~6 months
```

  power_adc_enable();
  int reading = analogRead(A0);
  float voltage = (reading * 3.3 / 1024.0) * 2.0;  // Voltage divider
  power_adc_disable();
  return voltage;
}

void checkLowBattery() {
